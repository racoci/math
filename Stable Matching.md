The Stable Roommate Problem

Visualization: Matrix $\displaystyle M_{kl}$ represents the ordinal preference that $\displaystyle k$ have for $\displaystyle l$

$\displaystyle MM^{T} =M^{T} M$ gives a symmetric matrix

The problem reduces to finding minimals of rows or minimals of columns. 

Usually a match is considered stable if there isn't pairs of pairs who would prefer a swap

An additional restriction would be to disallow any posssible permutation of pairs

Another option, to make it symmetric would be to ensure that the algorithm is not giving unfair advantages to anybody, a criteria for this would be to ensure the result would be the same if roles were permuted. In the limmit we would want to have the same result even for any possible permutatation. We'll call this Meta-stable
