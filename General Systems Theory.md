(00:04) this course is an overview of the foundational concepts within system theory in particular it is focused on conveying what we call the system's paradigm that is the basic overarching principles that are common to all areas of systems thinking and theory systems-thinking has been defined as an approach that attempts to balance holistic and analytical reasoning in systems theory it is argued that the only way to fully understand something is to understand the parts in relation to the whole system's thinking concerns
(00:37) an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entire system by taking the overall system as well as its parts into account this paradigm offers us fresh insight that is not accessible through the more traditional reductionist approach this course explores the foundations to systems theory the process of reasoning called synthesis and its counterpart analysis the central theme throughout the course will be on understanding these two basic processes of reasoning
(01:09) and how they relate to each other thus enabling the student to become more effective in their reasoning and modeling in the first section of the course we start off by taking an overview to the systems paradigm we will talk about how systems thinking helps us to gain an awareness to our processes of reasoning their assumptions strengths and limitations we will try to understand what paradigms in general are before going on to talk about theories and the development of formal models in the second section we explore the two
(01:42) basic approaches of holism and reductionism and their counterparts synthesis and analysis which are the two processes of reasoning that form the foundations of systems thinking in this section we give a clear distinction between the two different approaches how they interrelate and the consequences of using each approach the third section covers the theme of nonlinear causality a recurring theme across all of the system science a major distinction between the analytical and synthetic approach is that between
(02:15) linear and nonlinear causality in this section we explore each and how they give very different conceptions to our understanding of cause and effect in the next section we explore the relational paradigm a way of looking at the world in terms of the connections between things the networked patterns they form and how these shape and define the overall system we go on to talk about the importance of interdependence and integration within systems thinking the final section of the course is dedicated to process thinking Systems
(02:51) Theory sees the world in terms of constant change and macro level processes that shape events through what are called systems archetypes likewise we will talk about the key structural process of differentiation and integration that drives evolution and change within all forms of systems this course is designed for anyone with an interest in systems thinking and theory and should be accessible to all by the end of the course students will have gained a new way of looking at the world what we call the system's paradigm
(03:23) that can offer fresh insight and a new approach to looking at virtually any domain of interest

Transcript:
(00:03) in this video we'll be giving an overview to what we call the systems paradigm which is the fundamental set of concepts that support Systems Theory and constitute this particular way of looking at the world in order to try and give a clear understanding will do this by contrast Nia with the more traditional paradigm taken within modern science this video will work as a high-level overview to what we'll be covering during the rest of the course we'll be touching upon all of the main ideas here so as to get a sense for how
(00:34) they fit together and then in later modules dig further into each aspect in more detail a paradigm is a model perspective or set of ideas that form a worldview underlining the theories and methodology of a particular domain the system's paradigm is then a coherent set of basic concepts and axioms that form the world view or perspective underlining Systems Theory and thinking or reasoning and scientific inquiry rests upon a set of assumptions or answers to fundamental philosophical questions before any kind
(01:12) of constructive inquiry into the world around us can be conducted a number of basic philosophical questions need to be answered including basic ontological questions such as what is the nature of being how does causality work etc basic epistemological questions such as how do we know something and how can we prove that we know it every coherent body of knowledge needs to provide some kind of answer to these questions which will then form the basis for that conceptual framework shaping how we see the world when using em and ultimately the kind of
(01:48) answers that we can derive within that paradigm for example pre-modern European culture provided answers to these questions based upon a fusion between the work of classical Greek philosophy and the Christian Bible among others this worldview of medieval thought created a hierarchical ontology of things that existed based upon their perceived proximity to God those things such as angels that were regarded as closest to the perfect being of God were placed at the top of the hierarchy with humans below this animals below them and so on
(02:25) all the way down to inert matter that was perceived as being at the lowest level and closest to hell within this worldview epistemological Authority or validity was derived from tradition if it was endorsed by some pre-existing Authority such as the Bible monarch or Aristotle's writing then it was deemed valid this is a very simplified schematic representation of course but it helps for illustration purposes with the rise of the modern era approximately 500 years ago a whole new set of philosophical answers were
(03:01) formulated to these fundamental questions but still today form the foundation of our scientific brain mark during a period of intense metaphysical questioning in the 17th century a number of thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Rennie de Carr laid the philosophical foundations to our modern world these thinkers asked and answered the most fundamental questions about the nature of reality and knowledge which were further fleshed out in the 18th century they fundamentally rejected the idea that knowledge of the world around us
(03:35) should be derived from Scripture theology or authority these natural philosophers posited that the world is physical in nature the knowledge about that world can be accumulated through empirical observations that the laws governing this world were as Galileo famously said it is written in mathematical language and its characters are triangles circles and other geometric figures without which it is impossible to humanely understand a word without these one is wandering in the dark labyrinth thus a new paradigm a method for
(04:12) deriving knowledge about our world was formed the so-called scientific method where empirical data could be collected hypotheses developed and experiments done to validate or invalidate those hypotheses in such a way new knowledge could be accumulated and it was believed that this knowledge should be put to the use of human betterment to curing diseases to growing more crops to building bridges etc this new paradigm was most powerfully expressed in the work of Sir Isaac Newton who did nothing less than describe a full mathematical and
(04:49) scientific framework for how physical systems interacted the central idea of which was that of matter in motion causing events that the world is governed by discrete components of matter interacting in a cause-and-effect fashion Newton's absolute space-time coordinate system is the framework for a fixed orderly predictable and deterministic universe where all events are driven by the linear interaction of discrete components of matter creating a mechanistic vision to the world what is called the Newtonian paradigm in a
(05:26) recent publication entitled science and culture the author writes about the development of this new scientific paradigm as such science has had an increasingly strong influence on European culture in the 19th century the buzzword for science was order scientists had discovered that the movement of the stars is predictable and the all terrestrial and CSTO phenomena followed the same scientific laws like clockwork they believed according to the Galilean vision that the book of nature is written in the language of
(06:00) mathematics with characters represented by geometric objects the vision of science was to discover the laws of nature and thereby explain all natural phenomena this faith in science gave rise to the philosophical movement called positivism which led to a widespread trust in science and technology and influenced social theory this paradigm supporting modern science went largely unquestioned until the beginning of the 20th century when quantum physics and general relativity showed its basic assumptions to be very
(06:35) much limited by the start of the second half of the century a new paradigm was gradually being formulated this new paradigm we can call the system's paradigm and it has a number of central concepts or axioms to it that work to counterbalance the traditional assumptions inherent within the Newtonian paradigm the traditional paradigm of the modern era has posited a strong dichotomy between the subjective and objective since before rainy day cards formulation of a philosophy based upon a mind and body dichotomy modern science has been
(07:13) strongly focused on the objective material world questions concerning the subjective dimension of the observer have been largely excluded in favor of a quantitative analysis of objective material components and linear interactions this is resulted from the beginning in a strong divide between science and more subjective interpretations of the world such as religion or many forms of philosophy persistence paradigm breaks down this barrier positing the subjective dimension of the individual interpreter should be of equal importance to our
(07:50) understanding of the world system's thinking sees any knowledge of the world as a product of an interaction between the conceptual system used by the individual community and the objective phenomena being observed thus to gain a fuller understanding of the world one must both question and develop the subjective framework being used as well as what's being studied to do this it is important that the assumptions paradigm and model used within an inquiry are made fully explicit so that everyone can examine the assumptions and bias that
(08:25) may distort the process systems thinking places great emphasis on recognizing and asking how do I see the world how do other people see the world how do those models and assumptions that we all hold shape and create our interactions and the world around us one of the central tenants of systems-thinking can be summed up in this simple statement we've met the enemy and he is us that is to say a recognition that how we see the world creates how we act in the world which creates the world around us which then
(08:59) feeds back to present us with challenges all of which are the product of our subjective interpretation thus for systems thinking there needs to be a balanced emphasis on the subjective models and assumptions as on the objective inquiry that were engaged in systems thinking is based bun a very different process of reasoning from that used in our traditional scientific paradigm the Newtonian paradigm is understood to be primarily reductionist which means that whole systems are seen to be reducible to an account of their
(09:36) constituent parts reductionism as a fundamental assumption leads to a process of inquiry called analysis analysis is a process of inquiry that proceeds by breaking system's down and trying to understand the whole in terms of the properties and interactions between its elementary parts in isolation from its environment the analytical method has been central to modern science and accountable for many of its successes through isolating systems decomposing them and searching for linear interactions of cause and
(10:09) effect systems-thinking is characterized as being what is called holistic meaning that it always refers to the whole system or environments as the most appropriate frame of reference for understanding something in order to understand some component or system we must understand the context that it is a part of its interaction with other systems and its functioning within the hold environment the process of reasoning that follows from this is called synthesis synthesis is the opposite from analysis in that it means
(10:43) putting things together synthesis is the method of inquiry used within the holistic approach whereby we look at the relations between things and how when we combine them we get the emergence of new levels of organization a central part of the analytical paradigm is the idea of linear causality the primary endeavor of modern science has largely been to control four external variables to isolate one or two input variables that are thought to cause some effect within the system these cause and effect relations are
(11:23) encoded in equations and thought to describe how the system behaves the central aim of the analytical paradigm is to ignore weaker influences from the environments and develop a model that is based on what are considered to be key observations which are the primary driving variables causing change within the system state linear causality follows a sequential order where a direct link between cause and effect can be drawn with there being a clear beginning and a clear end in time effects can then be traced back to one
(11:57) or a limited number of causes this paradigm is extended to general reasoning when people see events as a product of some linear interaction from A to B to C etc systems-thinking in contrary is focused on nonlinear causality where multiple factors affect an outcome as they work together synergistically in a networked fashion to generate a combined result that is greater or less than the sum of their effects in isolation a central idea here is that of emergence with emergence an event may not have any direct cause instead within the system's
(12:38) paradigm many events are seen as in fact emergent phenomena not caused by any one thing but instead they emerge out of the interaction between many things interacting in a horizontal parallel or network fashion to generate the emergent outcome equally systems thinking looks for circular or mutual causality how two things affect each other and how every effect feeds back to its source over time Systems Theory fundamentally rests on a relational or interactional view of the world that is to say that the connections between the parts is
(13:20) explicitly given ontological precedence over the parts themselves in the general sense a system means a configuration of parts connected by a web of interdependent relations when talking about any system the emphasis is typically on the connections and inche dependencies as the defining feature to the organization the relational paradigm of systems thinking emphasizes how connections interdependencies and context shape the component parts of the system and not vice-versa which is the more traditional assumption
(13:57) the traditional analytical paradigm is fundamentally component based analysis is focused on the properties of things in isolation and how those things cause change through direct interaction this perspective leaves us with a vision of the individual or component as the primary actor affecting change within their environments it downplays the influence of connections and context in affecting and shaping the individual parts system thinking helps instead to focus on how the network connections around the individual parts and shape the
(14:34) system as a whole this perspective becomes of particular relevance when the system comes to have a high degree of connectivity the analytical approach is typically based upon excluding a changing environment as described by the term ceteris paribus which means all other things remain in constant this static nature to the environmental variables makes it possible to repeat an experiment to isolate and to take stable cause-and-effect interactions that are believed to be the drivers of change which leads to predictable outcomes as
(15:12) long as it's possible to hold the environment constant this is in contrast to the systems-thinking paradigm which is very much process orientated in nature it takes a dynamic vision of the world where everything is seen to be fundamentally in change this change is typically not perceived to be initiated by any of the particular parts to the organization but instead is driven by processes that have inherent patterns the drive and shape the individual events that constitute them environments are seen to be complex and
(15:48) constantly evolving as a product of many interacting variables leading to the emergence of new forms of organization over time processes of change can be driven by macro level feedback loops that create certain dynamics and patterns of change on the macro level what are called systems archetypes due to this feedback and emergence change within the systems paradigm is seen as an evolutionary process rather than a mechanistic developments new phenomena emerge that could not have been predicted a priori due to the nonlinear interactions
(16:24) between the parts between the parts and their environments and because of past events feeding back on themselves all of which make the future essentially unpredictable in nature

Transcript:
(00:03) systems-thinking in its most general sense is a way of seeing the world for anything it places great emphasis on the question of how do we see the world that is to say our subjective interpretation of events human beings are not infinitely knowing creatures we have a limited set of sensory and cognitive capabilities with which to interpret events this limitation manifests itself in the fact that our attention is always limited our reasoning is often biased and we're continuously using many assumptions to take shortcuts and
(00:40) rapidly draw conclusions from the system thinking perspective it is seen as paramount to gain an awareness to what these limitations and bias within our reasoning and models are at the heart of systems thinking is a recognition of this subjectivity that is the recognition that how the world appears to us is not merely in some objective form but in fact our conceptual system structures defines and interprets every piece of information and endeavor that we undertake whether in science management engineering or everyday life
(01:17) indeed it is precisely because of this system's thinking would hold that any serious endeavor means first to understand the structure and makeup of the paradigm that is being used this is in contrast to our more analytical approach which holds that the world is largely objective it simply exists and we just need to go and discover how it works here little reference is made to the assumptions and overall paradigm used to understand the world the main emphasis is simply on building models with which to understand some objective
(01:51) reality systems thinking would put forward the idea that the subjective dimension of how we interpret events is just as important as objective inquiry that if we do not understand our subjective processes of reasoning we have no real way of knowing if they're truly valid or invalid whether what we know is based upon a coherent and sound set of assumptions or is it in fact based upon a weak or misleading set of assumptions assistant thinking then puts a much stronger emphasis on self-awareness where awareness is the ability to know
(02:29) directly to perceive to feel or to be conscious of events objects thoughts emotions or sensory patterns awareness of one's way of seeing the world and the process through which we reason is seen as a prerequisite to effective cognitive capabilities in this sense we can understand systems thinking as a form of meta language in that one of its explicit aims is to help individuals to understand their processes of reasoning and how our actions and the world they create lead directly from how we reason and see the world
(03:06) David Baum the famous 20th century physicist talked about this as such the reason that we don't see our problems is that the means by which we try to solve them are the source that may seem strange to someone that has first heard it because our whole culture prides itself on thought as its highest achievement and the achievements of thought I am NOT trying to say are negligible there are very great achievements in technology and various other ways in culture but there's another side to it one of the obvious
(03:38) things wrong with it is fragmentation thought is breaking things up into bits which should not be broken up we can see this going on we see the world is broken up into Nations yet the world is one and you can see with the nation we have the boundary of the nation we have established the boundary of a nation now that is invented by thought if you go to the edge of the nation there's nothing there particularly this quote illustrates well how our very thinking creates the world around us and ultimately how it creates the problems
(04:12) that we encounter before anything it is in understanding these processes of reasoning and the paradigm the constitute our way of seeing things that we have the greatest chance to make a difference to gain a deeper understanding of the world around us and a greater capacity to act effectively within it cognition is a very demanding exercise and thus it makes sense for us to use preconceptions and assumptions to limit the demand on this energy expensive exercise these tools of preconception and assumption based reasoning are an
(04:46) important form of abstraction but we need to be able to use them instead of them using us to be an effective thinker is to understand the dynamics of the conceptual system that we're using and this gives one the capacity to use it in a professional manner to generate knowledge instead of it using us as we simply react to our preconceptions our tacit assumption is that we are in control of our thought processes and how we see the world the Enlightenment gave us the conception of the rational individual the idea that humans are
(05:22) endowed with the capacity of abstract thought that modern humans are rational and calculating that we use our intellectual capabilities to act in a purposeful way however over the past thirty years or so as this idea of the rational individual has come under scrutiny within economics and the social sciences it's proven limited in scope humans are capable of abstract reasoning but this is typically not what people do for most people it is not particularly enjoyable and often an over demanding exercise more often instead we use all
(05:58) sorts of automatic inference processes based upon assumptions so is not to have to reason in this process we are not active agents of our thought but instead are guided by assumptions to be an effective thinker one needs to hold an awareness to our set of assumptions beliefs and understand the paradigm that we're using one needs to be aware of the assumptions the one is using and be able to adjust them when needed to use concepts and processes of reasoning like a professional uses her tools and not letting those tools use us which is
(06:35) often the case David bomb again pusses well when he says quote there is this feeling when we're thinking about something it does nothing except inform you of the way things are and then you choose to do something that is the way people are talking but the way you think determines the way you're going to do it and then you don't notice a result comes back but you don't see it as a result of what you've done even lest you see it as a result of how you are thinking unless the thinking changes it won't be correct
(07:06) unless we see the source of em it will never change we mean some kind of awareness of what thought is doing let's put it that way that seems clear but which we don't have generally speaking systems-thinking recognizes that it is before anything how we think that creates the world we live in the system's thinking is primarily concerned with the metacognitive skills that are required to understand appraise and use thinking effectively and constructively so this is where we start with the system's thinking journey it is to say
(07:43) how do I see the world what is my set of assumptions beliefs and values and then to go out into the world and notice how the way that you see the world affects how you act in the world the way in which your worldview influences and decides what you're going to pay attention to and also decides what you are not going to pay attention to both shaping our perception all day every day

Transcript:
(00:03) one of the great achievements of human creativity has been the development of abstract representations of the world around us indeed this capacity for abstract thought is a characteristic of modern humans and it has much of its origins in the development of language as a way of symbolizing and communicating abstract concepts this capacity for abstract modeling forms the foundations to our advanced civilization and has extended the human ability to much better understand the world communicate that understanding between
(00:35) each other and to collaborate around these shared models a model is an abstract typically compact for a presentation of some phenomena that enables us to conceptualize and communicate its basic structure and dynamics in a coherent form a central characteristic of models and modeling of all kind is the use of abstraction whereby various levels of detail are removed from the original empirical phenomena in order to create a compact schema or diagram of the system under consideration models help us organize and structure
(01:13) information clarify our reasoning communicate solve problems and predict future events abstraction is the process of considering something independent of its associated attributes the use of abstraction involves removing successive layers of detail from a representation in order to capture only the essential features for the generic to all entities of that kind independent of their specific form abstraction involves the use of inductive reasoning that is to say identifying common attributes to a variety of instances of some entity and
(01:53) the formation of a generic model that captures the fundamental aspects of it without reference to any specific instance or context an algebraic equation an architect's master plan of a building or a non figurative painting would be good examples of abstract representations they all have in common the aim of capturing and communicating only the most essential features to the system they're representing by removing specific concrete details of their form or function all models are simplified representations of reality models
(02:31) required the compression of information or data to generate a simplified form this simplification process is essential for grasping the whole of the system most systems in the real world are far too complex for us to grasp as a whole due to their many diverse parts interactions and scale in practice we can typically only interact with and experience a small subset of a system abstraction helps us to synthesize our many experiences of some entity into a coherent impression of the whole for example one may have a model as to what
(03:08) a nation like Brazil is like but one could only ever in reality interact with a very limited subset of that whole organization thus it is the model that actually enables us to in some way grasp the whole system but only ever through the use of abstraction that creates a simplified representation of the actual real-world phenomena a central part of modeling is the use of encapsulation encapsulation means to cover or surround something in order to show or express only the main idea or quality of it in a concise fashion
(03:45) encapsulation is a central part of modeling and designing systems in that it enables abstraction through encapsulation the internal workings of any component part of a system can be concealed in order for it to reveal only the most essential properties and functionality required for its interaction with other components in such a way encapsulation abstracts wave the internal details and complexity of a subsystem to enable the effective designing functioning or vision of the whole system abstraction involves the induction of
(04:22) ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something it is the opposite of reification which means to make something real bringing something into being or the making of something concrete whereas abstraction is designed to remove the specific reification involves the opposite process of specification which is the analysis or breaking down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete specific facts for any abstraction to have real-world application it must go through a process of reification and specification in
(05:00) which the detail of the abstraction is specified in order to create a real instance of that generic form all of its real instances must have specific attributes this process may also be called instantiation the process of instantiation is one of taking an abstraction giving a detailed form within some real context this process involves specification whereby the generic features of the abstract model must be given specific attributes in order to become a specific instance of that generic form and exist within
(05:35) some real-world context for example if you want to build a house an abstract model designed to describe what a house in the abstract is would not work you would need one that specified all of the details to your particular house and your particular house would then be an instance of the generic class of all houses the process of modeling through abstraction invariably requires the one makes certain assumptions and often approximations for example in their models Newton assumed that mass is a universal constant whereas Einstein
(06:12) considered mass as being a variable a model only ever represents some subset of all possible phenomena and thus has to make certain assumptions about other elements and systems outside of our focus of interest effective models make explicit the assumptions that they entail the conditions under which those assumptions will hold and the conditions under which they will not hold and then we'll be prepared to relinquish the validity of the model under those applications outside of the scope entailed by its assumptions for example many of the
(06:47) models that management use in order to deliver their strategy or take a product to market are only applicable under relatively normal market conditions management strategy is typically only expected to account for events that are less than a few standard deviations from the norm however extreme events do happen and in such circumstances the management team would have to relinquish their model and recalibrate their strategy being aware of the assumptions or axioms that support a model is greatly advantageous as it enables the
(07:21) user to know when to apply it and why not and it equally offers the possibility of switching to other frameworks when required and also the opportunity to stay working on those assumptions so as to improve them the effectiveness of a model may be defined along a number of different parameters for example how solid are its foundations that is to say the assumptions that it's based upon are they truly self-evident assumptions or are they contingent upon certain conditions that may not always hold how well does the model allow us to grasp
(07:54) the whole system and identify its core attributes does it truly managed to synthesize all of the different perspectives on that system how faithful is it to the empirical phenomena does it stand up to empirical testing and moreover can I predict future events models are often evaluated first and foremost by their capacity to match empirical data any model inconsistent with reproducing observations must be modified or rejected a model should have the capacity to explain past observations and predict future observations within some context for
(08:34) example one perceived limitation in our standard economic and financial models is that they seem incapable of predicting financial crisis even though they work to a certain degree during normal economic conditions to be effective a model must capture diverse information perspective and views on a particular phenomena for example if we take some complex entity like a city there will be multiple perspectives on how to interpret it social technological economic demographic etc an effective model must be able to integrate all of these
(09:09) diverse perspectives in some way to give us a vision of the whole system and a basic understanding of its primary constituent parts and relations and thus an effective model can be seen to be a balancing act between simplicity through abstraction and synthesis on the one hand and on the other hand breadth of scope in order to include all of the different views and possible instances of that system the scope that the model covers is an important metric in its evaluation models like that of general relativity are highly valued due to
(09:44) their relevance to any physical system from the scale of a molecule all the way up to the level of the universe to be effective a model should contain within it and extend to all instances and applications of the system it is trying to represent although models almost by definition must be compact representations they must also be inclusive entailing within their core form the capacity to derive any possible instance or stayed to the phenomena under their description models are powerful tools in that they enable us to conceptualize large systems
(10:24) that are beyond our immediate faculties and they always do this by removing certain details if the model is not built properly that is to say all relevant information is not represented in the model in a compact form thus representing only a partial account as to how the world is if we then use those models to operate in the world the results may be at best only partially successful and at worst a potentially dangerous situation in fact we now have a term for these poorly built mathematical models they're called
(10:57) weapons of mass destruction abstract models constrain our perception they contextualize frame and condition what we see and don't see models that are poorly built and do not include all relevant perspectives and information can blinders to what would otherwise be obvious information in a very literal manner models can remove one from one senses in that they are conceptually based if they are not adequately built they can create nonsensical results one good example of this will be models used in economics that try to describe
(11:36) human actors as rational agents these models of the rational agent are constructed in a particular way so as to make human economic activity amenable to standard mathematical tools in the everyday world it is quite apparent that people do not always consider all actions in a rational fashion we take many shortcuts have personal bias copy others use heuristics etcetera none of which are rational but none of this can be properly captured using our standard formal mathematical models and thus it is excluded from standard economic
(12:09) theory of course the world does not change simply because it does not fit into our modeling framework whenever there is a mismatch between a model and the empirical world it is ultimately the model that has to give and break down at some stage we may go on using limited models because that's all we have but there will clearly be consequences for doing this thus it is always desirable in modeling that we'd be explicit about the limitations of a model and work towards developing more robust models whose foundations are more solid scope
(12:42) broader or match more accurately empirical data and only ever partially trust models because they're always only partial representations of the world

## [Holism & Reductionism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_kbt7h1YRw)

Transcript:
(00:03) holism and reductionism represent two paradigms or worldviews within science and philosophy that provide fundamentally different accounts as to how to best view interpret and reason about the world around us reductionism places an emphasis on the constituent parts of a system while holism places an emphasis on the whole system while reductionism breaks an entity down so is to reason about the entire system with reference to its elementary parts holism tries to understand something in reference to the whole system or environment that it's a
(00:41) part of reductionism is the practice of analysing and describing a complex phenomena in terms of the elementary parts that exist on a simpler or more fundamental level reductionism attempts to create a unified description of the world through reducing it to a set of elementary components from which any phenomena can be explained as some combination of these parts the aim of reductionism is an explanation showing how higher-level features of a whole system arise from elementary components and thus the higher-level features of a
(01:18) system can be largely ignored within an enquiry allowing us to focus on the lower-level parts that constitute here reductionism implies an assumption that all higher-level phenomena can be understood as some combination of lower-level phenomena for example a reductionist approach to interpreting a biological entity like a cell might take such an entity to be reducible to collections of physicochemical elements like atoms and molecules it would then focus on understanding these parts and how they combine to give the high level
(01:52) functions and behavior of the whole cell instead of focusing on those higher-level features of the cell itself equally a reductionist approach to cognition would attempt to reduce higher level cognitive phenomena such as awareness emotions and concepts to the basic biophysical building blocks of the brain neurons and synapses the theory of methodological individualism within the social sciences would be another example of a reductionist approach in that it requires that causal accounts of social phenomena be explicable through how they
(02:28) result from the motives and actions of individual agents the common theme among different reductionist positions consists above all of their emphasis the complex phenomena should be explained by statements about phenomena that are over simpler more basic nature holism refers to any approach that emphasizes the whole rather than the constituent parts of a system holistic accounts of the world would look for how an entity forms part of some larger whole and is defined by its relations and functioning within that border
(03:06) system what all holistic approaches have in common includes the principle that the whole has priority over its parts and the assumption that properties of the whole cannot be explained by the properties of its parts which is the idea of emergence within this paradigm the ultimate sources of knowledge are seemed to derive not from elementary component parts but instead from reference to the system's broader context given that something can only be properly understood within this context to gain a fuller understanding of
(03:42) something requires gaining a greater understanding of the environment or context to that system holism posits that assistance behavior and properties should be viewed as a whole not as a collection of parts this often includes the view that systems function is holes and that their functioning cannot be fully understood solely in terms of their component parts for example social psychologists look at the behavior of individuals in a social context because group behavior like conformity cannot be fully understood by looking at the
(04:18) individual in isolation but instead is best understood by looking at the individual within the context of the whole social group this property to the individual of conformity only emerges when individuals interact in a social group likewise many phenomena such as the wetness of water only emerge when the two atoms of hydrogen and oxygen are combined to give water neither atom possesses such a characteristic in isolation and thus we can only talk about the wetness of water when looking at the component parts as a
(04:52) whole system when contrasted reductionism and holism lead to a number of fundamentally different perspectives on basic questions about causality objectivity structure dynamics etc while holism puts forward a top-down view of causality and a dynamic process orientated view of the world that is subjective in nature reductionism provides a more static bottom-up and objective perspective the reductionist approach typically adopts an objective stance the central tenants of Objectivism are that reality exists independently of
(05:32) consciousness and that human beings have direct contact with reality through sensory perception in its general sense objectivism is the position that there is a single real world in which human actors are embedded that these real-world properties and organizations are transparent to our perception and cognition and that is our or the scientists job to know this objective world through empirical inquiry to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between our conceptual representation of the world and the actual objective world
(06:07) that exists holistic approaches typically hold the idea that the individual or the scientists is not a passive observer of an external universe that there is no objective truth but that the individual is in a reciprocal participatory relationship with nature and that the observers contribution to the process is valuable due to this recognition to the subjective dimension of the observers interpretation holistic approaches are more inclined to begin by examining the subjective interpretations of the observer recognizing the need for an
(06:42) effective paradigm before an effective evaluation or model can be formed this recognition that the holistic approach gives to the subjective interpretation of the observer opens the door for the idea that there may be a multiple valid or at least valuable explanations for any phenomena thus while reductionism is inclined to search for one right answer holism tries to understand a phenomena by gaining as many perspectives on it as possible and then synthesizing these perspectives into a more complete understanding
(07:18) reductionism and holism represent two fundamentally different perspectives on the nature of causality reductionism strongly reflects a particular conception of causality reductionism leads the idea of upward causation seeing high-level phenomena as being caused by lower level entities phenomena that can be explained fully in terms of the relations of other more fundamental phenomena are called epi phenomena typically within the reductionist paradigm there is an implication that the epiphenomena exert no causal effects
(07:54) on the fundamental phenomena that explained them the EPI phenomena are often said to be nothing but the outcome of the workings of the fundamental entities as a result according to this view causation at higher levels of existence is always in some sense a derivative or epiphenomena caused by lower-level interactions reductionism then follows a strong organizational pattern of output causation within the reductionist paradigm upward causation appears the only real plausible scientific explanation of phenomena
(08:33) when the direction of causal influence extends from the macro level of organization down to the micro level this is termed downward causation holistic accounts are primarily interested in the workings of how the function and structure of an entity are defined by the broader system or hold that it is a part of as such it places a strong emphasis on downward causation how the whole a macro level effects a downward cause on the formation of the parts this downward causation can be understood as an inverse of the
(09:09) reductionist principle the behavior structure and functionality of the elements in the system are determined by the behavior of the whole here determination moves downwards instead of upwards one readily identifiable example of this would be the constraints and effect a society as a whole has on its individual members force exerting a downward causation this downward causation can be seen within societies where individuals create the culture institutions and norms but then those institutions feed back to constrain and
(09:43) enable the agents in the social system so that we get a continuous dynamic between the macro and micro levels with causality flowing in both directions the central aim of the reductionist approach is to reduce phenomena to their single lowest denominator and then define all higher-level phenomena in terms of these elementary parts thus reductionist approaches actively strive to reduce all accounts to a single dimension defining all high-level phenomena as deriving from a single lower-level dimension as such reductionism can be said to be mono
(10:24) dimensional in its structure because holistic accounts are grounded in the concept of emergence whereby new and qualitatively different phenomena and patterns emerge as we put things together it places a great emphasis on the multidimensionality two phenomena that exhibit any degree of complexity a holistic approach suggests that there are different levels of explanation and that are each level there are emergent properties that cannot be reduced to those of a lower level for example whereas a reductionist approach may try
(10:58) and understand a patient's mental disorder as purely chemical imbalances in the brain prescribing drugs to affect this a holistic approach would more likely look at different physiological cognitive and socio-cultural factors to deal with the condition at various levels and from different dimensions holistic accounts are typically process orientated in nature whereas reductionist accounts are more focused on the static properties of elementary parts within a reductionist scientific analysis variables in the environment
(11:33) are specifically kept constant this allows researchers to repeat experiments in exactly the same way and detect stable behavior in the variables that are being observed which in turn leads to predictable outcomes a central part of the analytical approach is the use of the concept ceteris paribus meaning all other things being equal variables within the environment are artificially held constant to isolate and perceive the linear effect of a limited number of variables under observation thus the use of reductionism within various domains
(12:09) often involves an attempt to be able to maintain variables within the environment constant so as to be able to control a given system through a limited number of variables one of the guiding rules of holism in contrast would be pant array meaning everything flows the idea that everything changes as derived from the Greek philosopher Heraclitus observation the one cannot step in the same river twice whereas reductionism breaks a process down into its static parts the holistic paradigm is focused on maintaining the
(12:44) whole process and is fundamentally concerned with how things change through the processes that act on them


## [Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ewi6movQk4)

Transcript:
(00:03) the word synthesis comes from the Greek word meaning putting together synthesis is a process of reasoning whereby we put disparate parts together to gain an understanding of the whole system synthesis may be contrasted with the opposite process of reasoning called analysis in that analysis involves taking things apart to understand their components synthesis and analysis define two distinct overarching patterns or structure to a process of inquiry whereas reductionism and holism represent two different paradigms or
(00:41) worldviews synthesis and analysis can be understood as the corresponding processes of reasoning that lead from these set of assumptions synthesis is the method used within a holistic paradigm with synthesis we understand something by looking at how the parts interrelate to form the whole and how this whole system functions within its environment because the holistic paradigm always refers to the whole in order to understand the parts synthesis reasons by looking at how the parts are put together to form the whole
(01:17) and how the whole system interacts with other systems and operates within some environments and this process of combining different things together to form a greater whole is called emergence in the process of emergence diverse elements interact self organize and combine to give rise to some combined entity that exhibits novel and different properties when taken as a whole synthesis tries to understand this process of emergence and how the interactions between diverse parts can create something new synthesis then takes a holistic view
(01:55) meaning it looks at the whole and it's primarily interested in the overall workings we regard a system as a whole units when we treat it as a black box and look at its overall behavior and function that is say what it does or accomplishes instead of looking at the internal parts to see how it accomplishes them for example architecture is often considered a holistic discipline as it is primarily concerned with how the whole building works rather than prioritizing any single elements in the building the architect must look at how the parts
(02:30) interrelate to form the whole system in contrast building engineers are required for the analysis and design of the physical component parts to ensure that it will function synthetic thinking has three main steps that can be seen to be the opposite of analysis to understand something using synthesis one has to firstly ask what is this a part of then identified the whole context that the system is a part of for example to understand a corporation it is necessary to identify the economy secondly we have to understand the
(03:08) behavior of the whole system for example one needs to gain a basic understanding of the transportation system and the economic system in order to understand the car and the corporation respectively finally we have to identify the function of the system we're trying to explain and how it is interrelated to other systems in the performing of that function for example understand the role a car plays in the transportation system and the role a corporation plays in the economic system both analysis and synthesis provide very
(03:46) different insights while analysis reveals the structure of the system and its internal workings synthetic thinking reveals to us why it behaves the way it does no amount of analysis to the French automobile would reveal why they drive on the right-hand side of the road why this happens is a historical contingent part of the broader evolutionary context within which the car exists whereas an analytical inquiry may give us detailed insight into the workings of something and thus an understanding of how it functions it is also argued that
(04:23) reductionist approaches do not allow us to identify why behavior happens for example an analytical approach could explain that running away from a large lion was made possible by our fear centers causing a stress response to better allow us to run fast however the same analytical view could not say why we were afraid of the lion in the first place in effect by being analytical we may be asking smaller more specific questions and therefore not addressing the big issues of wire system actually behaves as it does thus while
(05:01) reductionism is useful it can lead to incomplete explanations failing to give us answers to the ultimate question of why a system does what it does only really telling us how it does what it does synthesis results this by referring to the broader context synthesis helps us to understand the meaning of something because the meaning of something is in its functioning within some larger system a person finds meaning in their life by playing a part in some larger organization a mother playing her role in a family a person forming part of a
(05:37) sports team or a musician in a band it is only in reference to assistance functioning within a broader environments that we can derive answers to the question of why and it is only really in taking things apart and analyzing them that we can get answers to the question of how the effectiveness of either method is very much contingent on the context some phenomena and circumstances lend themselves well to analyst core reductionism others not so well which paradigm is most relevant may be understood to be contingent on the
(06:12) degree of complexity to the system we're dealing with simple systems are amenable to the reductionist analytical approach while complex systems typically are not due to their high level of interconnectivity and their interdependent nature the basic word synthesis means putting things together to form some new entity for example in botany plants perform the core function of photosynthesis wherein they use the sunlights energy at the catalyst to make an organic molecule from a simple carbon molecule the synthesis is essentially a creative
(06:49) process synthetic thinking is designed to create new out-of-the-box ideas and solutions whereas analysis can't really tell us anything fundamentally new it gives us incremental improvements in optimization because we're simply breaking things down it can only build upon what already exists while synthetic thinking can enable major paradigm shifts due to its creative emergent nature while analysis gives us differentiation which is important to achieving efficiency through specialization however it can lead to fragmentation
(07:26) over time synthesis puts things together first it plays an important role in systems integration making sure that all the parts are working together in an integrated fashion and that things do not become too fragmented for example within science systems thinking works to try and provide transdisciplinary models and frameworks that integrate the different domains of inquiry the analytical strategy is not able to consider the whole of a program because its primary focus is on individual tasks system thinking is required to balance
(08:01) this and maintain an overall integration thus ensuring that fragmentation does not occur synthetic thinking refers to the context or environment as the most important frame of reference for something to be a value or correct it must be aligned with the context within which it exists for example whereas within an analytical approach one might focus on the optimization of subsystems placing this as the highest priority even if it is at the expense of some other element system or the system's environments systems thinking would invariably give
(08:41) precedence to the system's environments positing that nothing can be correct or right without being what is best for the overall context but synthetic thinking can be an important element within a system to ensure its alignment with its overall environments and long-term sustainability a corollary to this is that because everything is seen as context-dependent holistic systems are optimized for adaptation and responding to change within their environments whereas an analytical paradigm leasts the idea of
(09:16) determinism and predictability because the focus is on the internal workings of a closed system that is to say everything that will exist already existed in the past and is determined by that synthetic approaches hold that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted no matter how much data is available nature and social systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior and it is suspected that the behavior of such systems may be computationally irreducible which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system
(09:51) state without a full simulation of all the events occurring within it in the face of this uncertainty adaptive capacity is seen as having great value within the holistic paradigm both synthesis and analysis are central to gaining a full understanding of any entity both have their achievements and limitations and both are required for a full balanced understanding of the whole and its parts


## [Causality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ykeBfd5ds)

Transcript:
(00:03) causality describes a relationship between two or more things where a change in one thing causes a change in another the essence of causality is a phenomena being dependent on some other effect as such causality is a connection or linkage between states or events through which one thing the cause under certain conditions gives rise to or causes something else what we call the effect causality forms a fundamental and pervasive part of our perception and interpretation of the world around us equally our ability to act in the world
(00:41) depends upon our grasp of causal relationships between things that is to say the way things act and interact in everyday life humans and other animals rely on the assumptions of causality literally every waking second and in academia much of science is the study of systemic cause-and-effect relations perceived causality involves the process of inductive inference the basic process of induction is one of inference from a set of things that have something in common to generalizing what we observe about them has been true for all
(01:19) instances of that kind we generalize from a sample of previous experiences to a whole population we project past uniformity x' in our experience onto future events through expectations we've seen a ball move off in the opposite direction every time that it was hit with the bat in the past so we assume it will be the same in the future and this assumption through inductive inference creates the perception of there being a causal relationship between things thus although cause and effect appear a central characteristic of our worlds
(01:56) they are in fact simply associations that we make between events the philosopher David Hume Illustrated how there are no necessary connections between events in the world in his words all events seem entirely loose and separate one event follows another but we can never observe tie between them they seem conjoined but never connected we perceive cause and effect and then extrapolate from that to infer cause and effect relations about things that we cannot see such as black holes subatomic particles or events in
(02:33) the future of course when we generalize we're going beyond the evidence by the definition of generalizing a conclusion covers things that we have not or cannot now the rising and setting and the Sun in the past cannot guarantee it will rise and set tomorrow conceptions of causality can be roughly divided into linear and nonlinear linear causality is the idea that cause and effect follow a single direction between events from a the cause to be the effect and that for every effect there is a single or limited number of causes
(03:10) nonlinear causality is the idea the causality may follow a bi-directional path from A to B or from B to a or even both at the same time and that there may be an unlimited number of causes for a given effect with linear causality there is seem to be a direct link between cause and effect cause precedes effect in a sequential pattern linear causality as a clear beginning and a clear end there is one or a limited number of causes for any given effect additional linkages of causes or effects create a line or a sequential domino pattern of causality
(03:53) the central ideas behind linear causality are captured in what is called the axiom of causality the axiom of causality is the proposition that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause this means that if a given event occurs then it is the result of a previous related event if an object is in a particular state then is in that state as a consequence of another object interacting with there previously the philosopher Plato stated this when he wrote in addition everything that becomes or changes must do so owing to
(04:34) some cause for nothing can come to be without a cause the three criteria for establishing linear cause and effect are Correspondence time precedence and non spurious Ness the first step in establishing linear causality is in demonstrating correspondence or Association this means asking the question is there a relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable correspondence or correlation means that the cause and effect occur within the same unit of analysis for example if being exposed to the cold is more likely
(05:13) to make you sick than people who are exposed to the cold should be more often ill time precedence means that the cause must occur before the effect if one wants to say that being well educated causes one to earn a higher salary than the cause of being educated must precede the effect of earning a higher salary a spurious or false relationship exists when what appears to be associations between the two variables is actually caused by a third extraneous variable this is captured in the saying correlation does not imply causation a
(05:51) phrase used to emphasize that a correlation between two variables does not mean that one causes the other for example a false correlation might be drawn between the amount of ice cream sold and the sale of sunglasses there is a hidden variable of temperature that is causing both to change together without there being a direct cause and effect relation between them this linear causality is a keystone of the analytical reductionist approach and searching for these linear cause and effects has formed the central part of
(06:25) modern science this process of inquiry is conducted by defining a closed system and then isolating it from its environment to control variables cause and effect interactions to search for as an explanation for how elements in the system behave within this paradigm cause and effect relations are seen to move in one direction that is from the bottom up and not the reverse direction lower-level phenomena are seen to cause higher-level events for example in asking why the body functions as it does we would refer
(06:59) to the internal constituent parts of the organs and tissues to derive an upward causal relation instead of looking for a cause within the system's environments which would be a form of downward causation linear causality equally leads to the conception of determinism in that it defines a closed system and reduces the number of causes to a limited set acting in a single direction reductionism and linear causality try to reduce the cause of an effect to a single or limited number of determinants and the fewer the
(07:35) number of component determinants that we identify the greater the determinism will be non linear causality cease causation as flowing in a bi-directional or multi-directional pattern nonlinear causality involves cyclical processes where one thing impacts another which in turn impacts the first although this chain of events leading to feedback may be mediated through several events or take place over a prolonged period of time nonlinear causality is part of the holistic synthetic paradigm that looks at systems within their context or
(08:14) environments as such it is much more focused on downward causation where there are many or even possibly an infinite number of interacting variables the holistic paradigm posits that effects can be the product of a great many causes to gain a full understanding of the effect we need nod drill down to find a single cause but instead look at multiple different factors and how they interact to give rise to the outcome as an emergent phenomena whereas in the linear model the relationship between cause and effect is seen to derive from
(08:50) one of the components affecting another within the system's thinking approach it is the relationship between the parts that is seen to create the effect for example from this perspective it is not the one chemical substance causes another to react in a particular way it is in fact the type of relationship between them that generates the emergence of a particular outcome and thus there is no direct cause and effect it is instead an emergent phenomena of a relationship of interdependence with nonlinear causality cause and
(09:26) effect can flow in both directions through time however this requires information and some kind of control system being involved purely physical processes results in a unidirectional flow to causality from the past to the future and not the other way around but once there is a control system involved this can define some future desired state the system's goal and then this can affect events in the present based upon information about the future for example whether I spend lots of money now may be contingent upon whether
(10:03) or not I think I will get paid at the end of the week thus with nonlinear causality causes for events may be derived at least partially from the future but this would only appear to be possible under the condition of goal orientated behavior where current events are conditioned and controlled by projections surrounding some goal in the future in a coming video we'll dig further into nonlinear causality as we talk more about in determinism downward causation and equal finality


## [Nonlinear Causality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76JRJ90s548)

Transcript:
(00:03) as we talked about in a previous module nonlinear causality is a form of causation where cause and effect can flow in a bi-directional fashion between two or more elements and where a single effect may have multiple causes or vice-versa the essential characteristic of nonlinear causality is the idea of feedback that an effect can create a cause but equally this cause can then feed back to create an effect in the first system nonlinear causality can be contrasted with linear causality where the direction of an effect flows in a
(00:40) Union direction nonlinear causality leads to a number of important outcomes that are not possible when considering more simple circumstances involving linear causality nonlinear causality can lead to self reinforcing or self amplifying processes through feedback loops thus allowing for disproportionality between initial cause and final effect the second important outcome to nonlinear causality is the bi-directional flow of causation between the macro and micro levels within a system thus enabling downward causation
(01:17) as well as upward causation thirdly it can allow for reverse causation in time that is to say set future goals can feedback to affect current events likewise non linear causality implies the action of many variables in creating a cause or vice-versa which can lead to equal finality the idea that some end effects may be created or reached through a number of different pathways finally in contrast the linear causality that creates a deterministic vision of the world non linear causality may lead to the in determination of outcomes
(01:58) feedback process our essential characteristic of nonlinear causation events do not happen in isolation but instead feedback to effect their source thus nonlinear causality can have the characteristic of being self-perpetuating or self reinforcing for example when we look at some relationship dynamic between a parent and child we might note that the child is uninterested in the parents because her parents showed no interest in her but equally her parents showed no interest in her because she appeared uninterested in the first place this is
(02:34) a self reinforcing loop enabled by nonlinear causality likewise the formation of hurricanes financial crisis animal stampedes or the development of new cultures will be other examples of processes driven by self reinforcing cause-and-effect whereas linear causation is defined by a degree of proportionality between a given cause in its effects nonlinear causality driven by this feedback can enable a disproportionality between cause and effect what is called the butterfly effect because of feedback loops small events can get compounded
(03:14) through each causal feedback iteration enabling a rapid change in proportionality between the inputs and outputs to the system the results of this can be widely divergent outcomes to some situation depending on small changes in input values what is called sensitivity to initial conditions whereas linear causation is predicated on being able to isolate a single or small amount of variables causing a given effect in searching for nonlinear causation we do not try to reduce the number of reasons or a given effect or
(03:54) vice-versa the number of effects deriving from a cause for example if we took the linear reductionist paradigm and asked the question why does an airplane fly this approach would try to reduce the cause to a limited number of direct physical interactions in which case the answer would be traced back to the dynamics of the airflow around the wing as described by a few variables within the navier-stokes equations of fluid dynamics inversely a nonlinear causal description may involve many different explanations
(04:27) this question we might say the flight is caused by the pilot directing the plane to its destination or the flights is caused by the fact that it was charted to fly at that particular time or that it's flying because the company can make a profit from putting on that flight without any of these factors the flight would not be happening when we take this non reductive more holistic interpretation to causality it's possible to see that some effects are the product of an almost infinite number of interacting factors and it stops
(04:59) making sense to ask about a single direct effect instead the language switches to that of emergence asking how many different factors interact in a specific fashion to create a given outcome with emergent phenomena creating high-level patterns that then feed back to exert an effect on the low level more elementary parts whereas linear causality implies that causation flows from the bottom up but not in both directions nonlinear causality and the idea of emergence enable the interpretation of events as both upwardly and downwardly caused with
(05:40) causation flowing by directionally from the micro to the macro and back again to illustrate this we might think about a polar bear and ask why is the polar bear colored white the reason that it is white one might say is because of its genotype which is a bottom-up answer but if we then ask why are its genes as such we would discover that there are products of evolution which is selected for the color best suited to that environments the polar environment is white so the genes have produced a white bear that have been selected for that
(06:15) environment if the bear was in the Canadian forest it would be a brown bear instead thus we see downward causation acting with the cause coming from the environment to affect the state of the individual likewise the specific atomic nuclear interaction in the interior of the star at any given time is determined by where the reaction is taking place within the overall star thus the overall structure of the system is affecting the specific phenomena in a downward fashion but again the micro level atomic interactions affect the whole creating a
(06:50) nonlinear causal relationship between the systems micro and macro levels with feedback between them these patterns have downward causal efficacy in that they can affect which causal powers of their constituent elements are activated and this has significant implications for our conception of determinism both top-down and bottom-up causation can occur at the same time whereas linear causality an upward causality lead to the vision of a deterministic world non linear causality leads to a greater capacity for in
(07:27) determinism in determinism is the concept that events are not caused or not wholly caused deterministically by prior events with linear causality a past cause creates a current effect in a single direct fashion with nonlinear causality a cause may create an effect but because of the top-down bottom-up bi-directional floats causality the context and conditions of this low-level interaction are conditioned by higher-level phenomena meaning the overall outcome is a product of this more complex interaction between the
(08:03) lower-level cause and effects interaction and the upper level organization that sets the context for that interaction thus enabling a much greater opportunity for in determinism the philosopher Robert van gulick describes this phenomena as such a given physical constituent may have causal powers but only some subset of them will be activated in a given situation the larger context ie the pattern of which it is apart may affect which of its causal powers get activated thus the whole is not any simple function of its
(08:39) parts since the whole at least partially determines what contributions are made by its parts thus with nonlinear causality the cause of events are not directly determined by preceding events but more emerge out of the bi-directional exchange between the condition said by the overall system and the local level interactions with nonlinear causality a single cause may have many effects such as a nerve cell sending out many impulses or inversely many causes may have a single effect such as a hurricane being a product of temperature pressure humidity
(09:20) etc this leads the idea of equal finality which is the principle that in open systems a given end state can be reached by many potential means the term and concept are derived from a hand stretch the development biologist and later applied by ludwig von bertalanffy the founder of general Systems Theory some systems have more than one pathway or process for achieving a given goal this increases the likelihood that the system will achieve its goal under various environments and circumstances if one subsystem is damaged or if
(09:57) environmental circumstances change significantly the presence of multiple mechanisms or pathways thereby increases the likelihood that the varying condition can be adapted to or overcome for example the human immune system has both a pre-existing component and induced antibody component to respond to foreign invaders some organisms have multiple pathways and use them in different environmental circumstances these redundant systems accomplish the same end but do so with more than one similar or equivalent channel
(10:35) our conception of time is closely connected to our understanding of causality a linear conception of causality leads to a unidirectional T to cause an effect over time and this is a fundamental component in structuring our understanding of past present and future when considering only matter and energy within a purely physical system this unidirectional T - causality with respect to time may hold however when we introduce information into the model it now becomes possible for future events to feedback to affect current events and
(11:10) thus enable reverse causation information encoding and processing is an essential feature of biological systems that differentiates them from purely physical systems and allows this departure from deterministic physical causality many entities have control systems that enable them to process information examples include animals humans social institutions and various kinds of technology with a control system the structure and initial conditions may not matter what matters is the goal future goals can determine
(11:45) current actions here we can note how causality is reversing as it goes from some projected future event back to affect the present state the human body is acting out this process virtually every moving second in that we typically formulate some goal before initiating any action such as desiring the future state of eating a meal before acting out the process of cooking him the physical structure and initial conditions determine the outcomes as governed by equations past effects caused current events going forward but with the
(12:20) control system the information defines assistants decide behavior or response and thus cause and effects are contingent on higher-level information whose cause is derived from some future projection you


## [Relational Paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS1aHu6oqTg)

Transcript:
(00:03) relational thinking is a way of seeing the world the places greater precedence on the relations or connections between entities rather than simply looking at those entities is discrete and sepra the main overarching principle in the relational paradigm is a shift in one's perception from seeing a fixed world made up of things and their properties to sing a world that is primarily made of relations and connections between those paths throughout the sciences relational theories in general are frameworks for
(00:35) understanding physical or social systems in such a way that the elements of interest are only meaningful in relation to other entities that is to say through their relations with the rise of network theory and computation relational approaches have developed in many different areas over the past few decades there are now relational theories in physics sociology psychology international relations and many more the traditional analytical approach taken within modern science is to understand the world through focusing on
(01:10) the properties of discrete parts holding these as ontological primary that is to say separate objects or entities are what are seen to be real and one must first have these entities before one can have the relations between them in a paper entitled what is relational thinking DDR Debus describes this component based paradigm is such a paradigm which is crossed modernity and which deploys itself more or less implicitly at every level of knowledge in the orientations given to practices in the way of relating to experience
(01:46) this paradigm is that of being individual one can say very schematically that modernity will have been a research almost exclusively on the conditions of experience the reasons modalities and characteristics of the individual granting it implicitly or explicitly an ontological privilege to the constituted individual reductionism is an attempt to trace back all phenomena to basic elementary parts and how those parts generate direct cause-and-effect interactions a classical example of this is methodological individualism which is
(02:24) the requirement that causal accounts of social phenomena explain how they result from the motives and actions of individual agents at least in principle the analytical reductionist paradigm excludes the idea the relations how two or more things interact can actually be the source in itself shaping those elementary parts the synthetic approach of systems thinking is instead focused on the relations between the parts it posits that the relations between the elements and whole networks of relations that form the context can and do shape the
(03:02) constituent parts in a two-way a reciprocal relationship within the systems paradigm causes are not traced back to the properties of component parts but instead are seemed to derive primarily from the relations between things in particular how whole networks of interconnections the form the context or environment can shape the individual parts by creating the context within which they act or operate for example two objects may have a particular color when taken in separation but when we place them side-by-side in relation to each other
(03:40) the initial objects colors may appear different the properties of the objects colors has not changed but they appear different because a relation has been added to them and it is this relation that is affecting the perceived properties of the elements as another example one could cite global cities like Singapore or Dubai which are a product of the context of globalization they are enabled and defined by global networks of connection such as air traffic logistics and financial networks these global cities are not entirely created by the local
(04:15) context but instead are defined largely by the global connections that shape them one of the most extraordinary swith in physics would be what is called quantum entanglement whereby two subatomic particles interact and become entangled with each other meaning that their spin position and other properties become linked or interdependent if one then makes a measurement of one particle that then instantly determines the other particle state there is no manifest interaction between them instead it is this relationship of entanglement that
(04:50) defines the properties of the paths these examples help to illustrate how certain properties features and dynamics only emerge out of the interaction between things and they are governed by the nature of those interactions thus it is important to use the relational paradigm to understand these phenomena the systems paradigm argues for a balance between the analytical approach focused on the paths and the synthetic approach focused on relations and over emphasis on the paths can lead to a narrow process of reasoning that creates
(05:25) its own limitations for example by focusing on the individual parts of society we derive the conception of the rational individual that is to say the individual that is driven solely or primarily by their own internal logic this conception of the rational agent then leads to defining any human action that is not logically reasoned through by the individual as irrational or unexplainable which turns out to be a large section of human behavior most humans do not rationally and logically reason through what they choose to do or
(06:00) believe instead they act based on the context and their connections with others people adopt a particular belief or opinion because it fits in with their culture that is to say their connections with others the form their socio-cultural context these choices are not derived from the individual making a logical decision but instead from the nexus of connections around them thus simply trying to understand human behavior as a function of the internally generated motives of the individual is a very much limited enterprise likewise
(06:35) trying to describe all phenomena in terms of the connections and context results in an equally limited perception to gain a complete understanding of some phenomena it is required that a relational paradigm is used to complement and balance this perspective paradigm' leads to an inversion of our traditional conception where discrete entities exist within an inert space with those component parts creating the actions interactions and relations from the relational perspective relations are what define how entities act and react
(07:13) it is the network of connections around an entity that creates the context for its behavior or form for example when looking at a sculpture we often assume it is simply the inherent properties of that item that define it but a sculpture is made up of what is called positive and negative space positive space refers to the object itself while negative space is a space around the sculpture that gives it form context and which we use to interpret the positive space this is analogous to the shift in perception brought about by the rise of
(07:51) modern physics utonium classical physics saw the environment of space and time is essentially absolute exerting no influence it was the object that affected change in interaction general relativity changed this though to a new perspective where space and time are a fabric and events are products of an interaction between the object and its space-time fabric here again the interactions and contexts is an active agent in shaping events and outcomes we cannot reduce everything to a description of the parts the relational paradigm fundamentally alters
(08:30) our perception of space the traditional component based conception of space is relative to objects and their physical extension which creates a three-dimensional Euclidean space one that is absolute in that it just exists and is not affected by the changes in components or connections the relational paradigm though alters this perception of space in the relations are defined by exchanges of some kind along every connection something is transferred information money heat light trust etc how close things are to each other is
(09:06) rare to how easily something can be exchanged through the connection the easier it is to exchange something between two elements the closer they are and thus within this relational paradigm there is no absolute space but instead a distance is defined by connections and the ease of transfer along those connections the same applies to any form of network of connections such as transportation networks with major hubs the will in effect be closer than other less well connected nodes because of their high degree of connectivity and not because
(09:43) of distance within some absolute form of space the relational paradigm has found application in many areas of science and will briefly highlight some of its main applications in physics a relational theory is a framework for understanding physical systems in such a way that the positions and other properties of objects are only meaningful relative to other objects in a relational space-time theory space does not exist unless there are objects in it nor does time exist without events space can be defined through the relations among the objects
(10:21) that it contains and considering their variations through time likenesses relational ism is one example of this describing space and time as systems of relations that exist between objects the alternative spatial theory is an absolute theory in which space exists independent of any object that could be immersed within it relational sociology is a collection of sociological theories that emphasize relation ISM over substantive ism in explanations and interpretations of social phenomena here paleo Donati known
(10:58) as the founder of relational sociology writes about relational sociology as such more or less implicitly the observer the social scientists takes for granted the concept of relations quiet Alice is not a first importance but must come after the terms that it connects this means that social relations are viewed as a product of individuals and of social structures as something that comes after them on the country the relational paradigm affirms in the beginning there is the relation relational psychoanalysis is a
(11:33) relatively new an evolving School of psychoanalytical thought considered by its founders to represent a paradigm shift in psychoanalysis an important difference between relational theory and traditional psychoanalytical thought is in its theory of motivation which would assign primary importance to real interpersonal relations rather than the instinctual drives of the individual Freudian theory with a few exceptions proposed that human beings are motivated by drives that are biologically rooted and innate the individual relation lists
(12:08) on the other hand argue that the primary motive of the psyche is to be in relationships with others relational ease posit that the personality emerges from the matrix of early formative relationships with parents and other figures complex interdependence in international relations is the idea that states and their fortunes are inextricably tied together through a complex set of inter dependencies that have grown up with the rise of global interconnectivity on different levels what is called globalization complex interdependent theory was a
(12:45) major challenge to the fundamental assumptions of traditional and structural realism which focused on military and economic capabilities to explain the behavior of states complex interdependence on the country highlights the emergence of transnational institutions through global relations and their capacity to affect the nation-state the rotational paradigm has been applied to many other areas and offers a fresh way of looking at age-old questions that can lead to totally new out-of-the-box insights and solutions in that it
(13:19) represents a complete shift in our perception to the nexus of relations and context that surrounds objects and events

## [Integrated Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD_D2X5ljgQ)

Transcript:
(00:03) integration means that bringing together or connecting of things it is the act of combining or adding paths to make a unified whole as such it can be defined as the opposite from this integration or differentiation which means to set apart the degree of integration to a system can be defined in terms of the integrity to the network connections between its parts the systems paradigm looks at the world in terms of relations and the integrity of those relations systems are integrated wholes whose properties cannot be reduced to those of smaller
(00:41) units instead of concentrating on basic building blocks or substances the system's approach emphasizes the principles of organization how the components are integrated into whole patterns of organization at a low level of connectivity what defines an entity is simply its set of elements but as the degree of connectivity is turned up it is the connections between the parts becomes a defiant the whole organization as an integrated system thus what defines a system is the degree of connectivity exchange and interdependence between the
(01:18) parts at a low level of connectivity and integration the system's parts define the relations and the whole but in integrated systems with the dense network of connections this is inverted as the parts come to be shaped by the connections in the whole system the degree of integration to the connections within a system is important because it defines how unified that system is the connections within a system enable the flow of some resource through those connections it is this flow of resources through the system
(01:53) into an interdependent whole it is the movement of blood through the network of veins within the body that is the primary integrating factor to the whole system likewise it is the flow of communications through a nation sport caste media the binds a modern nation-state into a single integrated socio-cultural units social capital likewise can be understood as the number of connections within a community a strong community is an integrated network of connections along which resources flow and which enables the
(02:26) community to experience itself and operate as an entirety every new connection made within the system allows some resources to flow more efficiently whether this is goods within a national transport network information to flow more freely around the world through telecommunications networks or resources within ecosystems through the exchange between the creatures the more the connections the greater the integration and the more the organization will form a unified system this integration may be understood as
(03:02) the opposite from integration as it defines the breaking up or the removing of connections and a reduction in overall integration as the system becomes disintegrated the relations are reduced and the parts become disconnected no longer interdependent the system returns to a simple set of components without unity to it from this perspective when looking at the difference between a functional community and a dysfunctional urban ghetto we would note that there is some integration within the first social network that enables the flow of
(03:36) resources between the members of the community while the dysfunctional community would represent a disintegrated Network that inhibits the flow of these resources and the overall functioning of the system although this integration can appear as being solely dysfunctional it does however play a major role in the development of a system without this integration there can be no reintegration for example on the level of the individual this dynamic process of integration and disintegration is captured in psychology
(04:10) under the term positive disintegration unlike mainstream psychology this theoretical framework views psychological tension and anxiety as necessary for growth these disintegrative processes are therefore are seen as positive whereas people who fail to go through positive disintegration may remain in a state of primary integration the connections within a system and its overall integration enable system-wide processes to take place through the connections the parts to assist them can become interrelated in performing some
(04:47) common function for example the human digestive system is a set of components that are integrated through an axis of connections to perform one overall macro operation of processing inputted food into nutrients to be circulated or for example when a business is operating as an integrated system production processes can take place that span the entire organization the system's functionality may be reduced by some part not functioning properly or through lack of interoperability between the elements leading to this integration
(05:25) integration through connectivity then forms the foundations of the process of emergence to achieve emergence within a system the parts must be integrated so that a global process can take place through those connections as another example of this through globalization which is the process of international integration we are witnessing the rise of global processes such as production and logistics processes that require the integration of economies and organizations across the entire planet integration is a defining factor to the
(06:02) autonomy of the system as what defines a system is the pattern of connections between its parts the greater the interconnections and interdependence between the elements within a system the more it can function as a coherent integrated whole defining its autonomy from its environments this exchange between the parts enables processes take place within the system that are autonomous to some degree from other systems in the environments within an integrated community of people there will be certain processes that take
(06:34) place making it a functional and autonomous society with beliefs social institutions and economic activity being integrated to form a coherent society dependence may then be understood as the opposite of autonomy and thus a lack of self-contained integration without appropriate connections between the parts the system requires more connections to other entities within its environments to enable its functional processes take place integration then is a defining factor to autonomy the word integrity evolved from
(07:12) the latin adjective integer meaning whole or complete integrity is the state of being integrated into a whole an individual's personal integrity for example is their capacity to define a set of moral rules and code that are coherent and to act in agreement with them integrity in this sense is generally understood as a personal choice to hold oneself to consistent moral and ethical standards integrity stands in opposition to hypocrisy where hypocrisy means a lack of integration between once stated values and actions
(07:50) hypocrisy implies that a party holds within themselves conflicting values and actions and thus there's the lack of integration when someone acts based upon integrity they act according to some coherent set of rules and this enables their autonomy from contingent events that are governed by a different set of rules in this integrity of acting consistently under the same set of rules the individual defines their autonomy and earns trust from others with integrity others can trust that they will continue to operate under the same
(08:27) consistent set of rules in the future in such a way others feel they know how they will act and can count on them to make actions based upon the rules they used in the past integration and disintegration form a dynamic process through which a system develops to become part of larger systems in environments as the integration to a system on one level must become at least partially disintegrated to promote integration on another level integration represents a unique set of interrelations between a group paths that define them as in some
(09:06) way autonomous from other systems in their environments but for a system to interoperate with other systems and form part of a more extensive environments some of the connections in the system will become compromised or redundant for example as a traditional community becomes integrated into a modern nation-state some of the local social economic or cultural connections will be replaced by those forming within the largest society thus at the same time integrating the smaller subsystems into the larger organization of the parent
(09:39) society but also working to disintegrate local connections within the community this new set of links work then to reduce the integrity of the original system in that they are governed by a different protocol and set of rules as defined by the larger organization likewise it works to reduce the original systems autonomy in that it now becomes more dependent on the broader system in some way


## [Process Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE5qq1Nf_D0)

Transcript:
(00:03) process thinking is a way of interpreting events in terms of the processes of change that create them it focuses on the nonlinear dynamics of change over time to create certain patterns out of which events emerge versus thinking involves considering phenomena dynamically that is to say concerning their movement activity events change in temporal evolution ludwig von bertalanffy noted how Systems Theory related to Heraclitus is perception of pantora meaning everything flows he wrote from the her equation and systems view structure is a result of
(00:43) function and the organism resembles a flame rather than a crystal such an approach to the understanding of phenomena draws its inspiration from process philosophy process philosophy is based on the premise the being is dynamic and that this dynamic nature of being should be the primary focus of any comprehensive account to how the world works this paradigm draws on a tradition of thinkers from Heraclitus to twentieth-century process philosophers such as William James Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead and many more who
(01:20) all in various ways viewed reality in terms of ceaseless change flux and transformation rather than a stable world of unchanging entities process thinking is a central part of the systems paradigm systems thinking is process orientated in nature where the world is perceived in terms of processes of change instead of static events it adopts a more process based ontology meaning that within the system's paradigm objects are not seen to create change through direct cause-and-effect discrete interactions but instead
(01:59) processes are seen to have internal patterns that generate and condition individual events this is an inversion of our traditional conception that sees objects as having precedence over processes of change and thus process thinking can be contrasted with our more static way of thinking that sees events as generated by linear cause-and-effect relations between a systems component parts even though we experience the world as continuously changing the modern analytical paradigm has long emphasized describing reality as an
(02:36) assembly of static events whose dynamic features are taken to be ontological a secondary and a derivative of the interactions between the elementary parts the analytical process of reasoning that breaks systems down to understand their individual parts leads to a detailed description of a systems constituent components and a static understanding of its structural properties systems thinking is focused on open systems within the context of their environments a key consideration is how systems change with respect to
(03:13) the changes within their environments this leads the idea of adaptation evolution where changes in the environments feedback to affect the system which must then adapt to these changes in this way the system can be continuously evolving to meet the changes within its environments the analytical approach in contrast is focused on closed systems with limited regard for the system within its environments a closed linear system can only change by generating different configurations of its in eternal parts with a limited amount of
(03:49) interacting parts there is a finite number of possible future states in a closed linear system there is limited possibility for emergence and thus the future can be said to resemble the past the future can be modeled and understood as some permutation of the past with a small number of interacting elements in a closed system sooner or later the system will have cycled through every possible permutation of its internal parts and then the future will involve revisiting previously experienced States linear thinking sees events happening
(04:26) through cause and effect interactions one thing causes another within a discrete event nonlinear closed-loop thinking skills leads one to see causation as an ongoing process rather than a one-time event events are feedback on themselves meaning that the history of past events matter as they feed in to shake current and future events within overarching processes of change these feedback loops over time form reoccurring patterns what are called system's archetypes as such how things come to be constituted reproduced adapted and defined through
(05:07) ongoing processes is seen to be central issues are always seen to be relative to time and frames in terms of patterns of behavior over time events then are not seen simply as the product of discrete cause-and-effect interactions at any given time but other product also of larger patterns the archetypes the condition the context within which these interactions take place process thinking encourages people to use the historical trajectory for stimulating and guiding inquiry into understanding the relationships that produce events
(05:47) the idea of synergies and non-linearity makes possible a conception of emergence the idea that interactions between the paths may create something new emergence describes a universal process of development whereby many parts interact in a nonlinear fashion to create something that is more than the sum of their parts in fact it typically produces novel unpredictable and unexpected phenomena the internet revolution would be a good example one cannot have fully understood how when we connected all these computers together
(06:22) we would get the emergence of social networking the app economy cloud computing and all the innovations that are still to be built on top of them when we talk about emergence is the process it really describes the process of becoming the emphases within the systems paradigm is on the process through which new entities become formed rather than the analysis of the structure to what already exists linear systems such as the pendulum are not in a state of becoming they have a finite amount of interacting components that
(06:58) cycle through a predetermined set of stages by understanding its structure we can understand the states the system would exhibit in the future however more complex nonlinear systems such as a bird go through a constant process of becoming whose end point is not determined yet but which sets the context for current events the analytical paradigm is based on a substance metaphysics which goes back to the pre-socratic Greek philosopher Parmenides substance Mehta physicians claim that the primary unit of reality
(07:33) called substances must be static they must be what they are at any instance in time in contrast process philosophy sees becoming as well as ways of occurring as central to any inquiry


## [Systems Differentiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNbNldxdo9g)

Transcript:
(00:03) integration and differentiation represent two different stages in the evolution of a system differentiation is the process whereby an integrated system becomes divided up into more specialized well-defined parts integration is the process whereby diverse elements become combined or synthesized into a whole system the process of evolution involves a dynamic interplay between systems differentiation where new different elements are created and systems integration where these elements that are best suited to the whole system are
(00:41) selected by the environment as the system becomes reintegrated differentiation means the process of becoming or making something different differentiation involves the process of disintegration the dividing up of an integrated system into more specialized subsystems through the process of differentiation or was originally a homogeneous system becomes heterogeneous as its constituent subsystems come to form their own identity and structural features that are distinct from each other differentiation enables specialization
(01:22) the formation of separate individual subsystems enables those components to focus more intensely on a particular function or activity thus allowing them to become more specialized in their activity than if they had to perform a large number of diverse activities systems differentiation is likewise a structural technique for solving the temporal problems of a system situated in a complex environment systems differentiation is understood in Systems Theory as a way of responding to and dealing with the complexity of the
(01:58) system's environments this is accomplished through the creation of subsystems in an effort to copy within the system the difference between it and the environments in this context the differentiation process is a means of increasing the complexity of the system since each subsystem can make different connections with other subsystems it allows for more variation within the system to respond to variation within its environment the development of modern societies into many different specialized institutions
(02:34) from what were largely homogeneous organizations within pre-modern societies is an often cited example of differentiation one of the central ideas of the system sociologist Niklas Luhmann was that modern society is differentiated into various self referential functional subsystems which operate according to their own particular logic without being subordinate to a central unit they are open for exchange with each other but also independent being largely responsible for their own functioning and development biological differentiation is the
(03:11) process by which cells or parts of an organism change during development to serve a particular function for example the cells of an animal in its early embryonic phase are identical at first but develop through differentiation into specialized tissues such as bones heart muscle and skin differentiation within a material is any process in which a mixture of materials separates out partially or completely into its constituent parts as in the cooling and solidification of a magma into two or more different rock types or
(03:49) in the gradual separation of the original homogenous earth into crust mantle and core likewise within economics product differentiation is a marketing process that showcases the difference between products differentiation looks to make a product more attractive contrasting its unique qualities with other competing products systems integration involves the interrelating and recombining of differentiated parts systems integration is the composition of a whole functioning system by assembling elements in a way that allows them to
(04:29) work together to achieve an intended purpose in engineering for example systems integration is defined as the process of bringing together the component subsystems into one system and ensuring that the subsystems function together as a whole system this integration requires the development of new layers of abstraction that can accommodate the diversity of the differentiated components it is designed to interrelate integration involves the development of a generic layer to integrate the differentiated elements for example to
(05:06) enable the development of a new level of socio-economic organization in the formation of globalization it is required that we develop some language through which the different societies can interoperate this integration process through which a new more abstract level of organization combines the elements also works to reduce their autonomy in order to align them within the functioning of the whole system for example the formation of the political entity of the European Union enables interoperability between the
(05:40) different countries but likewise constrains their national governments in a paper entitled a complexity trained on cells in the evolution of multicellularity daniel mac she describes this process in living organisms as such in evolution as high level entities arise from associations of lower-level organisms and as these higher level entities acquire the ability to feed reproduce defend themselves and so on the lower level organisms will tend to lose much of their internal complexity integration both constrains and enables
(06:18) differentiation cells in a multicellular organism can rely on the whole organism adapting to changing conditions via a multicellular as Bonz thus the individual cell can do away with its rarely used functions to become more specialized and differentiated within the whole organism and social insects demonstrate the same sort of trade-off individuals of a highly social ant species are less complex than individuals from socially simpler and species but it is the complex social interaction or integration between them
(06:53) that allows them to perform as a whole more efficiently differentiation and integration enable and create each other integration can only take place when there are different parts likewise differentiation can only occur through integration into a larger organization because elements that remain autonomous are required to perform multiple functions to maintain themselves within their environments differentiation thus actually becomes the basis for any form of unity since the unity of any subsystem can only be
(07:29) based on its difference from its environments a central part of an evolutionary process of developments is a dialectic interplay between a systems macro level that is integration into the whole and the micro level the differentiation of the parts this process of developments can be understood as a form of dialectic change it is the dynamic interaction between the process of integration and differentiation that drives the evolutionary process of development within the system in a dialectic bomb homogeneous systems divide to find their
(08:06) difference compete and then reintegrate into a more complex whole
